Welcome to the Trahan Automated Trading platform

This is not even close to complete yet, so don't try to use it.

To Do:
- Add proper threading threading.Event() calls
- Make threads into a class
- Clean up L2 notes
- Fix print screen overlay to keep ">>>" at bottom
- Start working on DataFunc and building that out!
- Create proper indexes in Mongo to increase efficiency

- Remove ticker data draw to mongo? Shouldn't be needed?

Completed:
- Level 2 works!

Best,
Andrew
